Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for classification or regression tasks.
The goal of the SVM algorithm is to find the best decision boundary, or hyperplane, that separates different classes of data.
This decision boundary is chosen to maximize the margin, which is the distance between the hyperplane and the closest data 
points on either side.

SVMs can also be used for non-linear classification by applying a kernel function, which transforms the data into a 
higher-dimensional space. This allows for the creation of more complex decision boundaries. 
Commonly used kernels include the linear, polynomial, and radial basis function (RBF) kernels.

The SVM algorithm also includes a regularization term, which is used to prevent overfitting. 
This term is controlled by a parameter called "C", which allows for some misclassification, referred to as soft margin.

SVMs are widely used in various applications such as image classification, bioinformatics, 
and natural language processing. They are known for their high accuracy, good generalization and ability 
to handle large datasets.
