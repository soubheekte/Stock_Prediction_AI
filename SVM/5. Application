Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a versatile algorithm that can be used in a variety of applications. Some examples include:

1. Image classification: SVMs can be used to classify images based on their features, such as shape and texture.

2. Bioinformatics: SVMs can be used to classify proteins and predict disease outcomes based on gene expression data.

3. Natural language processing: SVMs can be used to classify text documents, such as email spam or sentiment analysis of tweets.

4. Handwriting recognition: SVMs can be used to recognize handwritten characters or digits by learning from labeled examples.

5. Financial prediction: SVMs can be used to predict stock prices or credit risk based on historical financial data.

6. Medical diagnosis: SVMs can be used to diagnose diseases or classify patient outcomes based on demographic and clinical data.

7. Fraud detection: SVMs can be used to detect fraudulent activities based on patterns in financial transactions.

These are a few examples of where SVM's are widely used, it can be applied to any classification problem where the goal 
is to find a decision boundary that separates different classes of data.
