# Stock_Prediction_AI

Veterans says Stock Market is the most attractive way of losing money for new investors/trader, especially when the market is volatile. It is estimated by popular opinions that only 5% people is able to make money, other 95% lose money in long run in Trading. 

In this repository I will try to predict stock pricess on daily basis wwith different types of models and will check which model will predicts with atmost accuracy, consistantly. The Following are the ML models/Techniques which we will do the test:

  1. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs): These are a type of machine learning algorithm that are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. ANNs can be    used to analyze large amounts of historical data and identify patterns and trends that can be used to make predictions about future stock prices.

  2. Support Vector Machines (SVMs): These are a type of algorithm that can be used to classify data and make predictions based on that classification. SVMs have been used to analyze financial data and make predictions about stock prices.

  3. Random Forest: Random forest is an ensemble method which uses multiple decision trees to improve the overall accuracy. This technique can be used to analyze financial data and make predictions about stock prices.

  4. Time Series Analysis: This is a type of statistical analysis that is used to analyze time-dependent data, such as stock prices. Techniques like ARIMA, GARCH, etc. can be used to model the time-series data and make predictions about future stock prices.
  
  5. Sentiment Analysis: The process of computationally identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a piece of text, especially in order to determine whether the writer's attitude towards a particular topic, product, etc. is positive, negative, or neutral.
  
  
## Methodology

I will train models on the basis of historical data of atleast 3 to 5 Years and will try to attain high accuracy for my all models, after that that I will predict the prices of 10 stocks with all the trained models everyday before the markets open at 9:15 a.m. and record it. The opening and closing prices will also recorded.

This process will happen till one month and the consistancy will be checked. If the consistency is best for all then all the models will be ensembled at the end.
